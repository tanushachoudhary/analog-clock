## Features

- Real-time analog clock
- Smooth movement of hour, minute, and second hands
- Responsive design, works on desktop and mobile
- Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no libraries required

## Getting Started

To view and use the analog clock:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanushachoudhary/analog-clock.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd analog-clock
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**

   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file, or use a local development server.

## How It Works

- **HTML** provides the structure for the clock face and hands.
- **CSS** styles the clock, giving it a classic analog look and handling layout and animation.
- **JavaScript** calculates the current time, determines the rotation for each hand, and updates the DOM every second for smooth movement.

## Customization

- Change the size, colors, or style in the CSS to match your preferences.
- Add numbers or ticks to the clock face for enhanced readability.
